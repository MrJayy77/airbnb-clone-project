# Airbnb Clone Project

## üìå Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack web application designed to simulate the core functionalities of Airbnb.  
It focuses on backend development, database design, API security, and DevOps practices while preparing learners for real-world, industry-grade project execution.  

This project will provide hands-on experience with **team collaboration, scalable architecture design, feature-driven development, and CI/CD pipelines**.

---

## üéØ Project Goals
- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.  
- Understand backend architecture and relational database design.  
- Develop secure, scalable APIs.  
- Implement feature-driven development (authentication, booking, payments).  
- Learn DevOps skills by setting up CI/CD pipelines.  
- Strengthen project planning and documentation practices.

## üë• Team Roles
Each role in the project team plays a crucial part in ensuring successful delivery:

- **Backend Developer**  
  Responsible for building the server-side logic using Django, designing APIs, managing authentication, and ensuring scalability.

- **Database Administrator (DBA)**  
  Designs and manages the MySQL/PostgreSQL database, optimizes queries, and ensures data integrity and backups.

- **Frontend Developer**  
  Connects the backend APIs to a user-friendly interface (if frontend is added). Ensures responsiveness and good user experience.

- **DevOps Engineer**  
  Sets up Docker containers, configures GitHub Actions, manages deployments, and maintains CI/CD pipelines.

- **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**  
  Writes and runs automated/manual tests to ensure bug-free features and system reliability.

- **Project Manager**  
  Oversees project planning, task assignments, timelines, and team coordination.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Django** ‚Äì Backend web framework for building APIs and handling business logic.  
- **PostgreSQL / MySQL** ‚Äì Relational database system for managing structured data like users, bookings, and properties.  
- **GraphQL / REST APIs** ‚Äì Provides a flexible way for the frontend to query and interact with the backend.  
- **Docker** ‚Äì Containerization tool for consistent environments and easier deployments.  
- **Git & GitHub** ‚Äì Version control and collaboration platform for managing source code.  
- **GitHub Actions** ‚Äì CI/CD tool for automating builds, testing, and deployments.  
- **JWT Authentication** ‚Äì Secure token-based authentication for user sessions.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design
The database is structured around core entities that reflect the business logic of Airbnb:

- **Users**  
  - Fields: `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`  
  - Relationship: Users can list properties, make bookings, and leave reviews.  

- **Properties**  
  - Fields: `property_id`, `owner_id (FK)`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`  
  - Relationship: Each property belongs to a user (owner).  

- **Bookings**  
  - Fields: `booking_id`, `user_id (FK)`, `property_id (FK)`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`  
  - Relationship: Each booking is made by a user for a property.  

- **Reviews**  
  - Fields: `review_id`, `user_id (FK)`, `property_id (FK)`, `rating`, `comment`  
  - Relationship: Users can leave multiple reviews for properties they booked.  

- **Payments**  
  - Fields: `payment_id`, `booking_id (FK)`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_date`  
  - Relationship: Each payment is linked to a booking.

## üèóÔ∏è Feature Breakdown
The Airbnb Clone includes the following core features:

- **User Management**  
  Handles registration, login, authentication, and role-based access. Ensures data security and personalized user experiences.  

- **Property Management**  
  Allows property owners to create, update, and manage property listings with details like price, description, and location.  

- **Search & Filter System**  
  Enables users to browse properties based on location, price, dates, and amenities. Improves usability and booking efficiency.  

- **Booking System**  
  Users can reserve properties, view availability, and manage their reservations. Provides the foundation for the rental experience.  

- **Reviews & Ratings**  
  Users can rate properties and leave feedback, enhancing trust and platform reliability.  

- **Payments**  
  Secure handling of transactions linked to bookings, ensuring financial accountability and user trust.

## üîê API Security
Security is a crucial aspect of the Airbnb Clone Project. Key measures include:

- **Authentication & Authorization**  
  - JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.  
  - Role-based access to restrict actions to owners, admins, or guests.  

- **Data Protection**  
  - Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS.  
  - HTTPS for encrypted communication.  

- **Rate Limiting & Monitoring**  
  - Prevents abuse of APIs (e.g., brute force attacks).  
  - Monitors suspicious activity for enhanced security.  

Security ensures the protection of **user data, property information, bookings, and financial transactions**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline
A **CI/CD pipeline** automates testing, building, and deployment to ensure faster and more reliable development.  

- **Continuous Integration (CI):**  
  Automatically runs tests whenever code is pushed to the repository, ensuring stability.  

- **Continuous Deployment (CD):**  
  Deploys the application to staging or production environments without manual intervention.  

- **Tools Used:**  
  - **GitHub Actions** ‚Äì Automates tests and builds.  
  - **Docker** ‚Äì Ensures consistent deployment environments.  
  - **(Optional) Kubernetes / AWS / Heroku** ‚Äì For scaling deployments.  

This ensures the application is always **test-verified, secure, and production-ready**.
